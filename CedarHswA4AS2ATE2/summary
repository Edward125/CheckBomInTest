The device s1 does not have a library
object or source.  This is acceptable because the device is
marked as non-testable, i.e, IPG will not generate a test for
this device.  However, if you want disabling information or
safeguard information to be used for this device, you must
create the source and object.

  An analog powered test or analog part of a mixed test contained pins
  or nodes that were not accessible or not connected or defined in the board
  file. Consult the ipg/summary file to identify the problem device(s). IPG
  will mark the tests 'nulltest' in the testorder file if any pins or nodes
  in the test are unconnected or undefined in the board file. (WARNING IPG2800)



  Nodes on this board are not accessible.  Check the ipg/summary file 
  to identify the nodes, and verify that they should be inaccessible.



  A capacitor discharge test was generated, and is in the analog 
  directory.  Deletions of IPG-generated discharge statements in 
  the discharge file may result in damage to the scanner relays.



  Capacitors were found on this board that are connected to 
  inaccessible nodes and could not be discharged.  Check the 
  ipg/summary file to identify these capacitors.  FAILURE TO 
  PROPERLY DISCHARGE THESE CAPACITORS COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE 
  TO THE SCANNER RELAYS.



  Tests were generated for diodes and/or zeners that contain large-value
  parallel capacitors. To work correctly, including failing when the
  component is reversed, these tests may require a wait statement (wa) to
  be added manually.

The device s1 does not have a library
object or source.  This is acceptable because the device is
marked as non-testable, i.e, IPG will not generate a test for
this device.  However, if you want disabling information or
safeguard information to be used for this device, you must
create the source and object.
The device s2 does not have a library
object or source.  This is acceptable because the device is
marked as non-testable, i.e, IPG will not generate a test for
this device.  However, if you want disabling information or
safeguard information to be used for this device, you must
create the source and object.
The fixture has been modified.  Module Pin Assignment has added
new Agilent TestJet Mux/Port assignments for additional TestJet
probes.  Check the "fixture/testjet_mux" file for the new wires.
New TestJet wiring changes have been added to the end of the
existing MUX/port wiring addresses; no difference report has
been generated.
