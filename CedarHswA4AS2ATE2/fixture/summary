The fixture file will be initialized using values from a fixture
   default object.  All fixture options in the board file will be ignored
   except for fixture size and type.
   
   The default object is ./fixture_defaults.o. (WARNING BPL88)

Inserted fixture part number "44200S" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

Trying to find a placement for the board that is compatible
   with the board handler.

The board "Cedar-Hsw-1" was placed at X =  110348, Y = -85177
  with a rotation of  0.000 degrees.

E:/board/Cedar-Hsw-1/fixture/summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insufficient probing access has been provided on the node "1%+RTC_VCC", 
 causing the sense and power pins of supply 1 to share a probe.
 It is STRONGLY suggested that additional access locations be added to
 the node. This will enable the voltage to be sensed at the trace,
 on an independent probe, rather than on a power probe. (WARNING FXT77)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "1%+RTC_VCC" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

AGILENT ICT MODULE PIN ASSIGNMENT          Wed Feb 26 16:53:39 2014      

D:/boards/Cedar-Hsw-1/fixture/summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Module Pin Assignment was run at the standard experience level.
 
Module Pin Assignment did not add any new wires to or 
delete any wires from the wirelist.
 
                      ASSIGNMENT REPORT FOR ALL BOARDS
 
     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 0.327.
            The standard deviation is 0.132.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 1440 interface pins for 1145 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.795.
